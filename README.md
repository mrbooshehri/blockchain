# Prerequisites

## Cryptography

Cryptography is a technique to secure information and communication by
using a set of rule-based calculations called algorithms and some
mathematical concepts so only the right person can understand it .
There are three fundamental types of Cryptography: **Symmetric Key
Cryptography**, **Asymmetric Key Cryptography**, and **Hash Function**
. 

**Symmetric Key Cryptography** is an encryption technique that relies on
a single secret key for both encrypting and decrypting data . It is
also referred to as Single Key Encryption . 

**Asymmetric Key Cryptography** is an encryption technique that uses two
keys, a public key and a private key, for encrypting and decrypting data
. The public key is used for encrypting data, while the private key is
used for decrypting data . 

**Hash Function** is a technique that takes an input (or 'message') and
returns a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a
hexadecimal string . Hash functions are used to verify the integrity of
data by detecting any changes to the original data . They are also used
to store passwords securely .

# What Is a Blockchain? 

A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger
shared among a network of computers. It is known for its role in
maintaining secure and decentralized records of transactions in
cryptocurrency systems. However, blockchains can be used beyond
cryptocurrencies and are capable of making data in any industry
immutable.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

- Blockchain is a type of shared database that differs from a typical
	database in the way it stores information; blockchains store data in
	blocks linked together via cryptography.
- Different types of information can be stored on a blockchain, but the
	most common use for transactions has been as a ledger. 
- In Bitcoin’s case, blockchain is decentralized so that no single
	person or group has control—instead, all users collectively retain
	control.
- Decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data
	entered is irreversible. For Bitcoin, transactions are permanently
	recorded and viewable to anyone.

# How Does a Blockchain Work? 

Unlike traditional databases, a blockchain's
data is structured and accessed differently. It consists of programs
called scripts that enter and store information in blocks. These blocks
are linked together through encryption algorithms, creating a chain of
blocks. Transactions on a blockchain go through a specific process,
involving validation by miners or validators.

## Transaction Process

Transaction Process: 
Transactions on a blockchain follow a specific process. When initiating
a transaction on Bitcoin's blockchain, it enters a memory pool and waits
to be picked up by a miner or validator.

Mining Process: 
Once a transaction is added to a block along with other transactions,
the block is closed and encrypted using an encryption algorithm. Miners
in the network simultaneously try to solve a hash, generating a random
hash combined with a nonce (a number used once). Miners increment the
nonce until a valid hash is found, winning the race and receiving the
reward.

Confirmation and Block Validation: 
After a block is closed, the transaction is considered complete.
However, confirmation requires validation from five additional blocks.
This process takes approximately one hour in the Bitcoin network, as
each block takes around 10 minutes to be added.

Different Blockchain Processes: 
Not all blockchains follow the exact process described. For example,
Ethereum randomly selects one validator from users with staked ether to
validate blocks, which are then confirmed by the network. This process
is faster and consumes less energy compared to Bitcoin.

# Blockchain Decentralization 

Decentralization is a key feature of
blockchain. The data in a blockchain is spread across multiple network
nodes, preventing alteration by any single node. This distribution
ensures data fidelity and security.

# Blockchain Transparency 

The decentralized nature of the Bitcoin
blockchain allows for transparent viewing of transactions. Anyone can
track transactions live by having a personal node or using blockchain
explorers. This transparency enhances accountability and trust in the
system.

# Is Blockchain Secure? 

Blockchain technology offers security through its
decentralized and immutable nature. Once data is entered into a block,
it becomes irreversible. However, it's important to note that individual
implementations of blockchain may vary in terms of their security
measures.

# Blockchain Applications 

Blockchains have found applications beyond
cryptocurrencies. They are used in decentralized finance (DeFi)
applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), smart contracts, and various
other industries. Blockchain technology has the potential to
revolutionize sectors such as finance, supply chain management,
healthcare, and more.

# Ethereum layer 2

Ethereum Layer 2 refers to various solutions built on top of the Ethereum blockchain to address its scalability issues. The main challenge with the Ethereum network is its limited transaction throughput, which can lead to congestion and high gas fees during periods of high demand. Layer 2 solutions aim to alleviate these issues by processing transactions off the main Ethereum chain while still benefiting from its security.

There are different types of Layer 2 solutions, and here are two common categories:

1. **Sidechains:** These are separate blockchains that run in parallel to the Ethereum mainnet but are pegged to it. Transactions can be conducted on the sidechain, and users can move assets between the main chain and the sidechain. Examples include Optimistic Rollups and zk-rollups.

    - **Optimistic Rollups:** These solutions assume that most transactions are valid and only provide a fraud-proof if someone submits an invalid transaction. This optimistic approach speeds up transaction processing but requires a challenge period during which potential fraud can be identified.

    - **zk-rollups (Zero-Knowledge Rollups):** These solutions use zero-knowledge proofs to bundle multiple transactions into a single proof that is submitted to the Ethereum mainnet. This approach provides scalability benefits while maintaining a high level of security.

2. **State Channels:** These are off-chain channels where users can conduct multiple transactions without involving the Ethereum mainnet for each one. State channels enable faster and cheaper transactions, and the final state is then settled on the Ethereum mainnet.

Layer 2 solutions aim to increase the transaction throughput of Ethereum, reduce transaction fees, and improve the overall user experience. They enable developers to build decentralized applications (DApps) with improved scalability without sacrificing the security guarantees provided by the Ethereum mainnet. Adoption of Layer 2 solutions is seen as a crucial step in the evolution of Ethereum and the broader blockchain ecosystem.

Certainly! Here are some key features and aspects of Ethereum Layer 2 solutions:

1. **Scalability:** The primary goal of Layer 2 solutions is to improve the scalability of the Ethereum network. By processing transactions off the main Ethereum chain, these solutions can handle a larger number of transactions per second, reducing congestion and lowering transaction fees.

2. **Reduced Transaction Fees:** Layer 2 solutions aim to provide more cost-effective transactions compared to the main Ethereum chain. By offloading a significant portion of transaction processing to secondary layers, users can experience lower fees and faster confirmation times.

3. **Faster Transaction Confirmations:** Transactions on Layer 2 solutions can be confirmed more quickly than on the main Ethereum chain. This is because these solutions operate with different consensus mechanisms or optimization techniques that allow for faster block generation and finality.

4. **Interoperability:** Layer 2 solutions are designed to be interoperable with the main Ethereum chain, allowing users to move assets seamlessly between the mainnet and Layer 2 environments. This interoperability ensures that users can access the benefits of Layer 2 while still having a connection to the security of the Ethereum mainnet.

5. **Security:** While transactions are processed off-chain or on secondary blockchains, Layer 2 solutions maintain a strong connection to the security of the Ethereum mainnet. Various mechanisms, such as cryptographic proofs or periodic settlements, ensure the integrity and security of Layer 2 transactions.

6. **User Experience:** Layer 2 solutions aim to enhance the overall user experience by providing faster and more cost-effective transactions. This is crucial for the adoption of decentralized applications (DApps) and other services built on the Ethereum platform.

7. **Compatibility with Smart Contracts:** Layer 2 solutions are designed to be compatible with existing Ethereum smart contracts. Developers can leverage their existing codebase when deploying applications on Layer 2, making it easier to migrate or extend their projects.

8. **Ethereum 2.0 Integration:** Some Layer 2 solutions are designed to complement the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. Ethereum 2.0 aims to transition the network from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, and Layer 2 solutions can work in conjunction with these changes to further improve scalability and efficiency.

Overall, Ethereum Layer 2 solutions play a crucial role in addressing the scalability challenges of the Ethereum network, offering improved performance and cost efficiency for users and developers. As the blockchain ecosystem evolves, Layer 2 solutions are expected to become increasingly important in facilitating mainstream adoption of decentralized applications and services.

6. **Compliance and Regulations:** It's important to note that the regulatory environment around airdrops varies, and compliance with local regulations is crucial. In some jurisdictions, airdrops may be subject to securities laws, and projects may need to take steps to ensure legal compliance.

7. **Risk and Scams:** While legitimate projects use airdrops as a marketing tool, there are also scams and fraudulent airdrops. Participants should exercise caution and verify the legitimacy of airdrop campaigns to avoid falling victim to scams.

Airdrops have become a common practice in the cryptocurrency space and are often used to bootstrap a project's community, distribute tokens fairly, and incentivize user engagement. Users interested in participating in airdrops should carefully review the terms and conditions of each campaign and be cautious of potential risks.


Certainly, let's dive a bit deeper into the concept of airdrops in the context of cryptocurrencies:

1. **Types of Airdrops:**
   - **Classic Airdrop:** In a classic airdrop, tokens are distributed freely to the wallets of existing cryptocurrency holders. This could involve holders of a specific cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) receiving a certain amount of a new token based on their holdings at a particular snapshot in time.
   
   - **Task-Based Airdrop:** Some projects require participants to complete specific tasks to be eligible for the airdrop. Tasks may include joining a Telegram group, following social media accounts, or completing a simple form. These tasks are designed to increase awareness and engagement with the project.

   - **Holder Airdrop:** This type of airdrop rewards existing holders of a particular cryptocurrency with free tokens. The distribution is often proportional to the amount of the cryptocurrency held.

   - **Community Airdrop:** Projects may distribute tokens to members of their community or user base as a way to thank them for their support. This can foster a sense of loyalty and community engagement.

2. **Purpose of Airdrops:**
   - **Promotion and Marketing:** Airdrops are a popular marketing strategy to create awareness and interest in a new cryptocurrency project. By distributing free tokens, projects can quickly attract attention and build a community around their platform.

   - **Wallet Security:** Participants need to ensure the security of their wallets when participating in airdrops. Scammers may try to exploit individuals by posing as airdrop organizers or distributing fake airdrop links.

In summary, airdrops are a distribution method used by cryptocurrency projects to distribute free tokens, promote their platforms, and build communities. While they can be an exciting way for users to get involved with new projects, participants should exercise caution and conduct due diligence to avoid potential scams or security risks.


# Airdrop vs Swap vs Liquidity

1. **Airdrop:**
   - An airdrop refers to the distribution of free tokens or cryptocurrencies to a specific group of addresses. Airdrops are often used as a marketing strategy by blockchain projects to raise awareness, reward users, or encourage participation in their ecosystem.
   - Participants in an airdrop might receive free tokens simply for holding a certain cryptocurrency, being part of a specific community, or completing tasks like joining social media channels or referring others to the project.
   - Airdrops can take different forms, including traditional airdrops where tokens are sent directly to users' wallets, or liquidity pool airdrops where users are rewarded for providing liquidity to a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol.

2. **Swap:**
   - A swap, in the context of cryptocurrencies, refers to the exchange of one cryptocurrency for another. This exchange can take place on various platforms, including centralized exchanges (CEX) or decentralized exchanges (DEX).
   - On a centralized exchange, users typically trade on a platform that acts as an intermediary, matching buy and sell orders. On a decentralized exchange, users trade directly from their wallets without the need for an intermediary.
   - The term "swap" is often used in the context of decentralized finance (DeFi), where users can swap one cryptocurrency for another directly on blockchain platforms using smart contracts.

3. **Liquidity:**
   - Liquidity, in the context of financial markets and cryptocurrencies, refers to the ease with which an asset can be bought or sold without causing a significant impact on its price. Liquid assets are easily tradable, while illiquid assets may experience larger price swings with each trade.
   - In the context of decentralized finance (DeFi), liquidity is often associated with liquidity pools. Users can contribute their cryptocurrencies to these pools, providing the necessary funds for decentralized exchanges or lending platforms. Liquidity providers are usually rewarded with fees or tokens for contributing to the liquidity pool.
   - Liquidity is a crucial factor in determining the efficiency and functionality of markets. High liquidity contributes to lower trading costs, tighter bid-ask spreads, and a more stable market environment.

In summary, an airdrop involves the free distribution of tokens, a swap refers to the exchange of one cryptocurrency for another, and liquidity is the ease with which assets can be bought or sold in the market. These concepts are integral to the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, especially in the context of decentralized finance and community engagement.

# Smart contract

A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. It operates on a blockchain, and its execution is automated when predetermined conditions are met. Smart contracts enable trustless and secure execution of agreements without the need for intermediaries.

Key features of smart contracts include:

1. **Automation:** Smart contracts automate the execution of contractual terms. When predefined conditions, often referred to as "if-then" statements, are met, the contract automatically executes without the need for manual intervention.

2. **Decentralization:** Smart contracts run on blockchain networks, which are decentralized and distributed across a network of computers (nodes). This ensures that no single entity has control over the contract, enhancing security and reducing the risk of manipulation.

3. **Transparency:** The code and terms of a smart contract are typically visible on the blockchain, providing transparency to all parties involved. Participants can verify the terms and the execution of the contract.

4. **Trustlessness:** Smart contracts eliminate the need for trust between parties. The code enforces the terms, and the outcome is predetermined, reducing the risk of fraud or manipulation.

5. **Security:** Blockchain technology provides a secure environment for smart contracts. Once a smart contract is deployed on the blockchain, it becomes resistant to tampering or unauthorized changes.

6. **Immutable:** Once deployed on the blockchain, smart contracts are usually immutable, meaning they cannot be altered or tampered with. This immutability ensures that the agreed-upon terms remain unchanged.

7. **Use Cases:**
   - **Financial Transactions:** Smart contracts are widely used for financial transactions, such as transferring digital assets or executing complex financial agreements.
   - **Supply Chain Management:** Smart contracts can automate and secure various stages of supply chain processes, ensuring transparency and efficiency.
   - **Token Sales (ICOs, STOs):** Many initial coin offerings (ICOs) and security token offerings (STOs) use smart contracts to manage the distribution of tokens and the execution of investment agreements.
   - **Insurance:** Smart contracts can automate insurance claims and payouts based on predefined conditions, reducing the need for intermediaries.

8. **Programming Languages:** Smart contracts are typically written in specific programming languages designed for blockchain platforms. For example, Ethereum uses languages like Solidity, while other blockchain platforms may have their own languages.

9. **Ethereum and Smart Contracts:** Ethereum is a popular blockchain platform known for its support of smart contracts. Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is often used to facilitate transactions and deploy smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

The functioning of smart contracts involves several key steps, from creation to execution on a blockchain. Let's break down the process of how smart contracts work:

1. **Creation:**
   - **Coding the Contract:** A smart contract is created by writing code that defines the terms and conditions of the agreement. This code is typically written in a specific programming language suitable for the blockchain platform on which the contract will run (e.g., Solidity for Ethereum).

   - **Deploying to the Blockchain:** Once the code is written, it needs to be deployed to the blockchain. This involves sending a transaction to the blockchain network that includes the compiled code of the smart contract. The contract is assigned a unique address on the blockchain.

2. **Initialization:**
   - **Deployment Parameters:** Smart contracts can be initialized with specific parameters, such as initial values, addresses of involved parties, or any other configuration data. These parameters are included when the contract is deployed.

3. **Blockchain Validation:**
   - **Consensus Mechanism:** The blockchain network, which is maintained by a consensus mechanism (e.g., proof-of-work or proof-of-stake), validates and confirms the deployment of the smart contract. Once confirmed, the contract becomes part of the blockchain's immutable ledger.

4. **Execution:**
   - **Triggering Events:** Smart contracts are designed to execute automatically based on specific triggering events or conditions. These events are predefined in the contract's code and are often structured as "if-then" statements.

   - **Transaction Inputs:** When a triggering event occurs, a participant (or an external system) sends a transaction to the smart contract. The transaction includes the necessary inputs or data required to execute the contract.

   - **Code Execution:** The smart contract's code is executed on the blockchain's nodes. This execution is deterministic, meaning that given the same inputs and conditions, the result will always be the same.

   - **State Changes:** The execution of the smart contract can result in changes to the state of the contract or the blockchain. For example, transferring ownership of a digital asset, updating a record, or triggering a payment.

5. **Consensus Confirmation:**
   - **Validation by Nodes:** The blockchain nodes validate the transaction and the execution of the smart contract according to the rules defined in the blockchain protocol and the contract's code.

   - **Consensus Agreement:** Once the majority of nodes reach a consensus that the transaction and the smart contract execution are valid, the changes are committed to the blockchain. The contract's updated state is now visible to all participants.

6. **Immutability:**
   - **Finality and Immutability:** The result of the smart contract execution becomes part of the immutable blockchain ledger. The contract, its code, and its state are visible and accessible to all participants on the blockchain.
